            <h4>Programming and designing are just a few of my many passions. Ever since I was little, I loved delving into different technologies, even coding a Club Penguin fan page 
            website when I was in middle school. Since then, I have taken my programming to the next
            level at the University of Georgia, where I am in my fourth and final year, and really
            going strong in the technology realm. When I'm not focusing on school and programming, you
            will most likely find me playing golf, playing piano, creating art (both physically and
            digitally), and playing video games. Scroll down to learn even more about me!</h4>

I am majoring in Computer Science and I am completing a certificate in New Media. My final year will also mark my graduation from the Honors Program at UGA, which I was accepted to in my first year. In my time at UGA, I have taken on many roles as a student. I have been involved in the community as a teaching assistant for both Intro to Programming and Software Development. I have also served as Vice President at UGA's ACM chapter. When it comes to my studies, I have taken the time to do solid work, which shows with my 3.71 GPA. My classes have tested me on many levels, ranging from Software Engineering to Database Management to Global Information Systems. In these classes plus others, I have taken charge as a Project Manager of my teams for the term projects we had to complete. With my guidance plus the cooporation of me and my team, we have gone on to create multiple great softwares, such as an eVoting System, a website called Moodflix, and database management systems.</h4></div>

The first internship I completed was at The Home Depot Headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia, where I was a Software Engineering intern. At The Home Depot, I worked on the Home Delivery team, where I pair programmed with another intern to make a Home Delivery Map Application. This web application used Google Maps to visualize the starting points and destinations for all of the delivery trucks for The Home Depot. This application is now used internally on the Home Delivery team, especially for their Project Managers, in order to help visualize the delivery truck process to clients and other coworkers.
        The second internship that I completed was with The Climate Corporation in San Francisco, California, as a Software Engineering intern as well. At The Climate Corporation, I worked on the iOS Experience team and learned along about iOS development as a whole. My project was to make an internal app that used an existing service to help manage feature flags for their app, FieldView, and enhance the user experience that previously existed for this service. This app, which I named Grouper, is now used internally by the company as a whole, saving a lot of time and money because of the increased efficiency from the app.</h4></div>

My most prized leadership opportunity is one I am currently partaking in, as Vice President of UGA's Association of Computing Machinery chapter. In this role, I am in charge of our Special Interest Groups (SIGs), and ensure that they have the resources they need in order to succeed.I also ensure that all coordinating efforts are accomplished, in order for us to maximize our events and lead to successful turnouts. In the past, I have coordinated efforts in order to host Professor Talks, Career Nights, and socials for our organization. This year, I'll take on a lot more to ensure that our numbers keep rising and to ensure that ACM will make a large, positive impact on the Computer Science community at UGA! Along with ACM, I have also taken up several leadership roles elsewhere. One of my roles has been as a Design Coordinator for UGAHacks, which is UGA's annual hackathon. I helped coordinate with the rest of the leadership team about design efforts, including logos and banners, in order to help advertise and give a professional look to our hackathon. Another role has been as a Team Lead for UGA HEROs, which is a philanthrop organization to help raise awareness for children and adults with HIV/AIDs. Another role I have taken on is a part of the Banner Committee within my sorority, Alpha Chi Omega, as we ensure that all event banners are made and properly hung for each event. </h4></div>

The purpose of this app was to make it easier to manage feature flags with the implementation of a better user experience. Lots of design decisions were made, and I learned a lot about iOS programming and UX design decisions along the way. At the end of my internship, I was able to run Grouper through Fabric and out to production as a downloadable app. Because of this, Grouper is now used internally by the company in order to more easily manage feature flags, saving time and money because of this more efficent process.</h4>

Given a team, we were required to complete a term project that involved some sort of crowdsourcing. As a group, we came up with Moodflix. Moodflix allows the user to type in any movie to "Moodify" it, which then returns a percentage of emotions felt by watchers of the movie. For instance, Toy Story 3 may have 40% sad emotions and 50% happy emotions, and less than 5% disgusted emotions, along with other emotions. We took these emotional responses that we obtained and graphed them by their percentage, next to an emoji representing the emotion, in order to present the data in a clean, easily understandable way. In order to accomplish this, we used the Twitter, NYT Movie Reviews, and IBM Watson APIs in order to crowdsource information from tweets and movie reviews relating to the movie, and insert the text into the IBM Watson API that was able to give us feedback on the percentage of emotions felt in response to the movies by real people.</h4></div>

A voter was allowed to create and log into his or her account, and see the upcoming polls and elections, and which ones they were allowed to vote on, given the date and their zip code. If these fell in order, the voter was allowed to vote on the given ballot, and see real-time results from every voter who voted on the ballot. As for the elections officers, the system was designed to allow them to log in and create ballots, including polls and elections, and set the date they want the ballot to start and finish, as well as what zip code the ballot will be available for. This information was designed to be updated in real time, so when the elections officer finishes creating the ballot, the voter can see the upcoming ballot on their end.</h4></div>
