            <h4 style="font-size:20px;">Programming and designing are just a few of my many passions. Ever since I was little, I loved delving into different technologies, even coding a Club Penguin fan page 
            website when I was in middle school. Since then, I completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Science at The University of Georgia, and I am currently completing my Master's in Human Computer Interaction at Georgia Tech. When I'm not focusing on school and programming, you
            will most likely find me playing golf, playing piano, creating art (both physically and
            digitally), and playing video games. Scroll down to learn even more about me!</h4>
